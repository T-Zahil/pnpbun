## What is PnPBun?

> **Warning.** pnpBun is **extremely** fast. It is so fast it can make Slack, Steam, Notion and Chrome faster just by being installed on your computer.

So, here's the idea: pnpBun is like npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, npx, bower, verdaccio and ndm, except WAY faster. You won't have time to make you a cup of coffee between your installations.

## Install

Visit [Uneed](https://uneed.best)'s website, create an account, and upvote a product. That's it, pnpbun is installed on your computer. You will soon see a difference everywhere: even steam will be faster.

### Upgrade

You won't have to upgrade anything, ever. pnpbun is already perfect.
